## And something of a template/framework for spawning other projects

Not so important right now (tho good to try and remember lol, even tho setup turned out
easier than thought) but will def come in handy if migrate from Heroku!

Hetzner setup:
-enable swap
-docker stuff

In future write config files to automate most (all?) of it...
