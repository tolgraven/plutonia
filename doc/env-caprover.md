Not so important right now (tho good to try and remember lol, even tho setup turned out
easier than thought) but will def come in handy if migrate from Heroku!    

`docker stuff`    
`npm install -g caprover` (actually on local machine hehe for auto pushes and that)    
`caprover serversetup`    
    
In future write config files to automate most (all?) of it...
