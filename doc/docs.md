### DOCS
# tolgrAVen website
## And something of a template/framework for spawning other projects

Using Codox for doc generation. Plan is to have it run on heroku on build and go straight into resources,
so can serve (after grabbing everything in body) within page.
But also want it indexed in Typesense so will have to do something on back-end boot for that.
Parsing it somehow...
