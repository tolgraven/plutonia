Attempt at making an actual website off html/css mockup did for school last year.
Very early stage, ported existing stuff and added a bit, mostly made worse.
Will incorporate more code from my other projects and then turn to backend rendering,
some lil CMS, a real db, yada yada.

Don't forget to update here and in .org ya dummy
