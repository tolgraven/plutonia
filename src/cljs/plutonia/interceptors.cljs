; then chuck it in std interceptors attached to everything?
; (guess same as local-storage thingy)
; then again, a let w computed value and just mirror that...
; but auto path would be main thing.
; also be careful with these things heh surely this was what was overwriting my shit before
; when wouldnt get comments etc through to firebase with write haha.
;
; seems more reasonable to just stick to events for eeet :P

; like what makes this necessary is we've now got variants of same logic
; in swapper and buncha components, slightly different each time.
; Not a massive deal if only doing it for special ones but want for all.
; Jarring when all is smooth except for disappearances.
;
; major issue is react normally to equivalent changes of value
; like a tab key going :main to :detail.
; or it would slooooow down nav haha.
; meanwhile using state and not content heavy content or similar should
; men it's pretty lightweight.
