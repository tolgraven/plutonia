;; :dispatch-throttle
 ;;
 ;; This will only dispatch the event at most once per every 'window-duration' milliseconds.
 ;; The throttled function can be configured to dispatch on the leading, trailing or both edges of this window.

 ;; Note: When both leading and trailing flags are enabled the event will be dispatched on trailing edge only if there are more than one event.
 ;;
 ;; usage
 ;;
 ;; Expects either a single map, or a sequence of maps.
