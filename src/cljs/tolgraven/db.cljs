                            Currently studying computer science, and having picked up some web design chops last year, I'm building this website from scratch as a learning environment.  The hope of course being it'll one day reflect something real.
                           My plan is to build a simple CMS, plus blog/comments system with user accounts. I think the Clojure and ClojureScript ecosystem seems good in this regard. It's daunting, but the lack of rails, as it were, might force a deeper understanding of each aspect. And it's close enough to the JS ecosystem everyone is in that skills will surely translate.
                            Also, Hiccup is awesome.

                            Well let's see what else. I make music, have dabbled in being a rave promoter, soundboy, am a big enough ally to have hosted gay parties in Uganda, and all-around upstanding chap. I reckon.
                            Before I run my own web design/custom music tech/yada yada real company I still try to do those things, on a hobbyist basis.
                            Currently most of the front-end is finished (well, pre-alpha finished) while the back-end is, shall we say... not. Everything will be hooked up in due time though. And optimized - this website hardly currently plays nice with more limited hardware. But have a look around, you can make a user account and post away at the blog. safe in the knowledge it won't leave your browser.  "
